# Flutter Public API App

***Original requirement was:***
This Flutter application fetches and displays data from a public API. You have the flexibility to design the architecture and user interface according to your preferences, but you must meet the following requirements:

## Task Definition:
1.  **Present Data from a Public API**:
    -   Create a section that displays a list of items.
    -   Implement a detailed screen for each item.
2.  **Two Screens**:
    -   The first screen should list available data.
    -   The second screen should show detailed information when the user taps on an item.
3.  **Search Bar**:
    -   Add a search bar to the list view so users can search for specific data.
4.  **Sorting and Filtering**:
    -   Allow users to sort or filter data based on different parameters.
5.  **Persistent Filters**:
    -   Implement a feature that allows users to save their current filters and apply them each time the app launches.
6.  **Navigation**:
    -   Use a navigation element of your choice (e.g., Drawer, BottomNavigationBar, TabBar) to switch between sections.

## Guidelines:
-   **Design and Architecture**:
    -   The design and architecture of the app are entirely up to you.
    -   We will evaluate your code quality, not your design choices.
    -   You can use default Material or Cupertino widgets.
-   **Platform Compatibility**:
    -   The app should be runnable on both Android and iOS devices.

## Requirements:
1.  **Flutter Version**:
    -   Use the latest stable version of Flutter.
2.  **JSON Parsing**:
    -   You can choose any JSON parser (we recommend using the  `json_serializable`  package).
3.  **Null Safety**:
    -   Ensure your code is null-safe.
4.  **Version Control**:
    -   Use Git for version control.
    -   Create a Git repository and share it with us once your project is ready.

## Final Remarks:
***But at the end my decision as Flutter beginner was "only" to convert my other homework originally written in Android/Kotlin to Flutter...***
So some of the requirements are not met, but I learned a lot about Flutter and Dart in the first draft.
